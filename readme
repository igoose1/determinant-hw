Find determinant of a matrix with OpenMP
========================================

This project is a homework of computer architecture course.

In this project few interesting files:

	- determinant.cpp

		This is why you are here. This code computes a determinant of a matrix
		using as much cores OpenMP can find. It may be possible to compute
		faster but I couldn't figure out how.

	- determinant.py

		This is a Python solution powered by SymPy which was used for finding
		answers on custom tests.

	- generate_test.cpp

		This is a C++ code for generating custom tests.

	- all.do and other **/*.do files

		These are redo targets for building binaries, testing and cleaning an
		environment.

		See https://cr.yp.to/redo.html. Use http://www.goredo.cypherpunks.ru.

	- tests/*

		These are custom tests: every `in` is a file of input and `expected` is
		a file of expected output.

	- plots/stats.txt

		Results of benchmarking a program with different OMP_THREADS_NUM and
		OMP_SCHEDULE. All computing was done on AMD EPYC processor.

If you don't use redo you can get a binary with a similar command

	c++ -DTESTING -Wall -std=c++11 -O2 -fopenmp \
		determinant.cpp \
		-o determinant
